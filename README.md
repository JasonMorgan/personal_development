# personal_development

This repo is just for personal notes based on things I'm learning about myself.  Not likely to be interesting to anyone but me but anyone is welcome to review/update it.

Right now I'm breaking it into 3 main sections:

## Diet

Notes on good things to eat and avoid in order to maintain a healthy weight.

## Exercise

How to exercise and what things to do to stay fit and avoid hurting myself.

## Mental Health

Hopefully the thing I'll update the most.  This is where notes about managing my boundries and being good to other people will fit.
