# Controlling Anger when Agitated

So I'm writing this based on some feedback from my therapist.  Essentially I have a big problem with handling my anger when I'm feeling upset.  These notes cover a routine I can use when I'm getting into an argument or getting ready to deliver any sort of criticism.  It's super important to me to prioritize being respectful to the person I'm talking to as well as actively listening.  These steps should help with that.

## Body Language

It's become super clear to me that the first thing to do to maintain a calm and collected state when stressed is maintain a body position that reinforces that.  Leaning forward, pointing, or gesturing all increase my level of agitation/aggression, that's not helpful.  Instead keeping my shoulders rolled back and my hands crossed in front of my chest go a long way to keeping my feelings under wraps.  I find it really hard to yell or bully when I keep my body like that.  So that being said, in order to stay calm *Keep my shoulders rolled back and keep mt hands crossed in front of my chest.*

## Mental Exercises

Steps:

* Pause
  * Anytime you need to respond in an argument pause prior to thinking of a response
* Cycle through your core organizers (This refers to your ways of organizing your perception)
  * Body Sensations
    * Body Awareness
      * Are you moving?
      * What's your Posture Like?
    * 5 Senses
      * Focus on what you perceive with each sense
  * Feelings
    * What do you feel?
      * It's important here to identify what you're feeling and try and determine how strong that feeling is
        * Ex: Are you angry?  If so how angry are you on a scale from 1-10
  * Thoughts
    * What are you thinking?
      * Specifically are your thoughts aggressive/angry or are the sympathetic/empathetic?
* Focus on the present Moment
  * This is apparently a general mindfulness principle, the point is to ensure that everything your thinking about or reflecting on is something happening right in this moment.
* Acceptance
  * Just what it sounds like, that everything you've just reflected on represents the situation you're in at this moment.  You accept that that is what it is and deal with it.  You can't do a good job of talking to someone if you aren't able to accept what you perceive.
* Assess your mental state
  * Are you able to respond without being aggressive or mean?
    * Indicators that you can continue
      * Moderated or restrained anger
      * Reasonable or no tension in your body
      * You're able to empathize with the other person
      * You don't feel any desire to hurt the other person
    * Indicators you should take a break
      * Unmoderated anger
      * Muscle tension or shaky hands
      * Thoughts don't include any empathy or understanding for the other person
      * If you're have any trouble making it through the routine
